    "\n",
    "Till now you have dealt with functions manipulating data inside them which is also called the procedure oriented way of programming. But there is another more powerful way of organizing your program which gives you the flexibility to deal with data and functionality and wrap it inside something called an object. Since Python is a multi-paradigmed language, it supports object oriented programming (OOP).\n",
    "\n",
    "Class and objects are two important aspects in OOP. Class creates a new type altogether whereas object is an instance of an a class. These can have their own attributes i.e. characteristics and methods i.e. actions.\n",

    "Example of OOP\n",
    "For instance, John is an object of the class human with attributes like name, age and methods like speaking, eating etc."
