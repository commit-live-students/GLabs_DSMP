    "This code along is to study Amazon food review from customers, and try to predict whether a review is positive or negative. The dataset contains more than 500K reviews with number of upvotes & total votes to those comments.\n",

    "## Understanding the data\n",
    "Our main objective is to predict whether a review is Positive or Negative based on the Text.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we see the Score column, it has values 1,2,3,4,5 . Considering 1, 2 as Negative reviews and 4, 5 as Positive reviews. For Score = 3 we will consider it as Neutral review and lets delete the rows that are neutral, so that we can predict either Positive or Negative\n",
    "\n",
    "HelfulnessNumerator says about number of people found that review usefull and HelpfulnessDenominator is about usefull review count + not so usefull count. So, from this we can see that HelfulnessNumerator is always less than or equal to HelpfulnesDenominator.\n",
